# About

This website is where I write about my projects.

I got into coding when I was around 12, back when I played a ton of Minecraft.
There was this mod for the game called ComputerCraft that added computers to the
game. I thought that was really cool, so I ended up teaching myself Lua to
program those computers.

Later on, I started branching out into more and more languages, technologies,
and projects, and I eventually ended up with the almost-decade-long mess that
you can see on the projects. I wanted a place to share what I've made, so I
created this website.

This website has undergone 2 rewrites. Now, it is under construction.
