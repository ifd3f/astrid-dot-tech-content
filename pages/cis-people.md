# Things cis people often say when talking to trans people[^groups]

[^groups]:
    this also applies to neurodivergent, depressed, and of course, nearsighted
    people, among others.

[archived here from original thread](https://woem.space/notice/AZ9LfzneXjXrwP0R28).

- "you're nearsighted? oh wow, have you gotten the surgery yet?"
- "idk, are you really nearsighted? you don't act nearsighted to me"
- "okay so you say you 'feel' like everything is blurry. what does that mean?
  ive sometimes gotten dust in my eyes but i don't see how you can just 'feel'
  nearsighted"
- "ugh... why are you ruining your beautiful face with those glasses? you look
  fine without them"
- "ugh... why are you ruining your eyes with those contacts? you're ruining your
  eyes by putting them there"
- "ugh... i can't believe anyone would mutilate their beautiful, natural,
  working eyes by burning them with lasers just because they 'feel' nearsighted.
  medicine and liberalism has gone too far"
- "you're just wearing glasses because it's trendy to wear them! this has
  consequences on your eyes!"
- "can't you just like, not see things blurry? it's probably just that you're
  not focusing your eyes correctly"
- "noooo don't put glasses on ur so handsome"
- "humans didn't have glasses, contacts, or laser surgery to transition to
  sightedness for millenia. therefore it's all unnatural and bad"
- "oh, you don't want to get the surgery? you're not truly nearsighted then lol"
- "nearsightedness and farsightedness are just a way for millenials to feel
  special by adding labels onto themselves"
- "optometry is a fake science invented by (((them))) to weaken the white race"
- "sorry, your insurance doesn't cover optometry, so you'll have to pay for it
  out-of-pocket"
- "they're doing laser surgery on 6-year-olds who think their eyes are blurry!"
- "if you wish to see 20/20 unassisted then why don't you just wait until you
  die and reincarnate as a fully-sighted person?"
- "i have blurry vision and i just deal with it lol"

## Provided by others

- "All your friends wear glasses too. Must be peer pressure."
- "Autistic people are more likely to identify as nearsighted, so they must be
  denied glasses."
- "What if you regret lasering your eyes?"[^surgery-regret]
- "By being nearsighted, you are limiting my personal freedom to not be
  nearsighted!"
- "Do I have to wear glasses now as well?"
- "stop telling kids some eyes are different and need additional support above
  the «[x] has eyes»"
- "i dont need your bad eyes in my gene pool"
- "if your eyes not perfect, do you even need them? way too much hassle to deal
  with imperfection"
- "yeah, my grandma had bad eyes and instead of complaining she always inviting
  other grandmas to her bookclub to just read to each other aloud — and
  sometimes they didnt even need books!"
- "just squint! lots of people have blurry vision, and you don't see them
  wearing glasses."
