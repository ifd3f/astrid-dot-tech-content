I went out on a walk with my extendable antenna to test the APRS signal. When I
came home and looked at [aprs.fi](https://aprs.fi) I got a grand total of... 2
APRS packets out.

Turns out there is horrible I-gate and digipeater coverage in the Peninsula. The
nearest digipeater is 11 miles away, likely on the other side of a mountain, so
with my 6W transmitter, it's a fluke that the packets even got there!

I guess it's time to set up my own digipeater ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
