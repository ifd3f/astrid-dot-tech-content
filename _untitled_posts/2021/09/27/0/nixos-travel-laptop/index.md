I'm currently trying to set up my old laptop as a travel laptop. My regular
laptop is rather heavy (5.5lb + 1.5lb charger because it has trash battery
life), so this might be easier to bring to class. It's gonna run NixOS! I tried
to make it autowipe root like my server does, but unfortunately, due to me not
wanting to store passwords or even hashed passwords in Git, it's... difficult,
to say the least. I guess I won't autowipe it, then, but I will still treat the
machine as ephemeral, and try to store configs in the Nix files as much as
possible.
