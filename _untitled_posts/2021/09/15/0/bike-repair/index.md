My bike's chain was quite loose, and it kept slipping off the gears and rattling
as it ran across the chain guard. However, I repaired it at the SLO Bike Kitchen
today by tightening the chain and just giving it a big cleaning and re-lubing.
Now, it's well-tensioned and competely silent; so silent, in fact, that it
almost feels unnatural to me now.
