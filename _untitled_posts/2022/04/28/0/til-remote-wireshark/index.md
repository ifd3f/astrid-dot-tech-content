TIL that you can analyze live packets from remote network interfaces in
Wireshark with the following command:

```bash
ssh $SSH_TARGET "tcpdump -w- -i $REMOTE_INTERFACE" | wireshark -k -i-
```

It's essentially three commands glued together in a big pipe.

On the left side of the pipe, we have the following to connect to the machine
and capture packets in pcap format:

- `ssh $SSH_TARGET ...` means "SSH into the machine and execute the given
  argument"
- `tcpdump -w- -i $REMOTE_INTERFACE`, which is executed in on the remote, works
  like so:
  - `-w` selects a file to write to. In this case, `-w-` means "write to STDOUT"
  - `-i $REMOTE_INTERFACE` specifies the interface to capture on

On the right side of the pipe, there is `wireshark -k -i-`.

- `-k` means "start capturing immediately, don't bring up the start menu"
- `-i` selects an interface or file to get packets from. In this case, `-i-`
  means "capture packets from STDIN"

**Related note:** Oftentimes, when a flag that usually expects a file gets a
`-`, the program supports reading the data from STDIN, or writing the data to
STDOUT, depending on what the flag actually does. If you want to use the file
specifically named `-`, you should provide `./-` in that argument (i.e.
`-w ./-`)
