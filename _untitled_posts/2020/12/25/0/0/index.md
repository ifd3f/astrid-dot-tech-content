At
[IndieWebCamp Create Day](https://events.indieweb.org/2020/12/indiewebcamp-create-day-RePAgfMVxFWI)
today, I continued working on the commenting system for astrid-tech. I got the
following done:

- Markdown formatting with HTML cleaning. No injecting `<script>` tags for
  you >:(
- Wrote tests for the backend
- Made the frontend submit comments to the backend
- Implemented **oppressive moderator censorship options** such as removing
  comments and locking threads
- Added form validation

I also got some inspiration to start microblogging from
[Sarah Hibner and her change log](http://log.sarah-hibner.com/), which is what
this thing is. To be honest, this isn't really a "micro" blog anymore, given its
length, but we'll cut stuff down as it goes.

As of this time of writing, there is nothing in place to display these logs, and
they are just sitting inside my content repo.
