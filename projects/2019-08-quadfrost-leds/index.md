It's yet another IKEA 3D printer enclosure, but with custom electronics on it!
There's an [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/) plugin I wrote, that communicates
with an Arduino I programmed, which sends and receives signals of all sorts, so
the whole setup is less boring!

![The full setup!](./full-enclosure.jpg)

I also have a script that automatically runs every few minutes and takes a
picture of the printer. This image updates regularly.

## Feature List

- LED strips!
- Motorized "air filter"
- Limit switch to detect the front panel
- Thermometer to measure air temperature
- LCD display that shows:
  - Printer status
  - Print progress as a percentage
  - Air temperature

## Why?

The Monoprice Maker Select i3 v1 has no enclosure. So, this is how I used to
print ABS.

This is obviously a non-ideal setup.

My mom also wanted to get rid of a pair of LACK corner tables, so I decided to
hop on the
[LACK Enclosure train](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/cheap-simple-3d-printer-enclosure_7785/)
and build my own!
