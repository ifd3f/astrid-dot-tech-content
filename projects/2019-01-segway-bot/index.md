- Designed, programmed, manufactured, and assembled a robot that can balance
  itself for 30 seconds on a carpet floor.
- Fused data from accelerometer and gyroscope to determine robot tilt.
- Researched methods to filter data more accurately, including moving average
  and exponential smoothing, complementary filters and Kalman filters.
