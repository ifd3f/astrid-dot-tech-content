    This is the third major redesign of my website! This time, it has been
    totally rewritten as a static site in Rust. The build pipeline has been made
    significantly less complicated. I will publish a blog post Soonâ„¢ about the
    process.

    Oops, I forgot I had my news box despite the fact that it is in the dead
    center of my homepage.

    I did end up making [a blog post about the redesign](https://astrid.tech/2024/02/20/0/astrid-dot-tech-redesign/),
    and [another one in the meantime about the Conda Package Manager](https://astrid.tech/2024/02/24/0/conda-recipe-selector-abuse/).
