This laptop was acquired at the same time as
[the Lenovo](/computers/first-laptop). It was my mom's laptop, but then when she
got a new laptop, and the Lenovo was becoming a pain to lug around due to the
screws on its back, I took this one to school.

I think I replaced the OS with Lubuntu because I became a middle school Linux
purist. I don't remember much else about it.
