I don't remember much about this computer but it ran a pirated copy of Windows
XP.

My mom's friend's husband's work apparently was getting rid of this so it was
given to me.

I don't remember much about it but it was my first _personal_ computer that I
had, not shared with anyone else, and that it was a piece of shit with low
specs. I kept running out of storage space and getting viruses. I was not very
bright as a child.
