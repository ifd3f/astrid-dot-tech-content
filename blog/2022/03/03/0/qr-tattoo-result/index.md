**Content warning: this post mentions tattooing and has a small amount of skin
peeling.**

Following up from
[my last post about temporary tattoos](https://astrid.tech/2021/10/03/0/temp-tattoo-results/),
I finally got it permanently etched onto my skin! Thanks to Kelsey Kansas at
[Crybaby Tattoo](https://crybabytattoo.square.site/) in San Luis Obispo!

And yes, _it can be scanned._

## My tattooing experience

This was my first tattoo ever, so I suppose this post also doubles as a "my
first tattoo experience" post. I wasn't completely sure of what to expect, so I
did some research beforehand.

- There is pain, and lots of it.
- Don't consume any blood-thinning chemicals for 48 hours before the
  appointment. So, I essentially stopped drinking green and black tea for a few
  days.
- Stay hydrated in the 24 hours before the appointment, so that the skin absorbs
  the ink better. I grinded Factorio for too long the day before, so I
  shotgunned some water right before going to bed.

My appointment was on a warm Sunday afternoon, on February 27. I showed up to
her studio, and we got started.

### The stencil

As it turns out, the tattoo artist doesn't just freedraw the entire tattoo onto
your skin, which makes sense, since that seems like it would be very prone to
errors. Instead, they draw a stencil first, kinda like a temporary tattoo, to
mark where to draw.

Kelsey had a specialized stencil printer, but it didn't behave too well with
plain QR codes, because they have very large dark regions. So, I pulled out GIMP
and made a trace of it.

First, I tried selecting the black regions using the **Select By Color** tool,
then and using **Select > Border**. However, I realized that this method made
the outline go outside of the QR code's black sections. This isn't be very
desirable.

![The naive stencil I first generated, modified to demonstrate where it is relative to the shaded QR code.](./naive-border.png)

To get the border to be on the _inside_ of the shaded regions, I selected all
white pixels, also using **Select by Color**. I used **Select > Grow** by 4
pixels to include the outermost black pixels. Finally, I subtracted all the
white pixels, and created a useful result.

So, we printed out this result and the printer was happy with it.

### Actually tattooing!

The stencil was actually applied in a very similar way as
[the temporary tattoos I made](https://astrid.tech/2021/10/03/0/temp-tattoo-results/),
also by using water to make it stick to the skin. The only difference is that
the temporary tattoos were more like a transparent sheet with stuff on it, while
the stencil didn't have a transparent sheet, it just deposited ink on my skin.

Then, Kelsey started drawing the outline. Holy crap, it _hurt_. People were
_not_ lying about how much it hurt.

Once the outline was done, she shaded it in.

After two hours, the tattoo was complete! I gave it a quick scan, just to
confirm, and it scanned!

### Aftercare

Kelsey placed a seram wrap thing on my arm, which theoretically would be placed
on my arm for 7 days, and removed, and the tattoo would be fully healed.
Unfortunately, because it was close to my elbow, my movements made it peel off.
I asked Kelsey about it and she suggested I just take it off and go through the
regular healing process, which she texted me.

I've been using Dial Gold soap and Aquaphor. I re-apply the Aquaphor during
breaks at school, and wash the region with the soap in the morning and at night.

It is Day 4 after tattooing and it still scans. The skin is peeling, but that's
expected during the healing process.

## Tattoo Controller Server

The tattoo actually points to a very basic web service that I wrote in Rust to
perform the on-demand redirection. I actually completed it sometime in November
2021, well in advance of actually getting the tattoo.

It has a very barebones admin panel that lets me paste in a URL and select where
I want it to go. I'll eventually write up more details about the implementation
[on the project page](/projects/qr-tattoo).

![A screenshot of the admin panel.](https://astrid.tech/_/projects/qr-tattoo/admin.jpg)

Using this server, I was able to rickroll a few people with this tattoo, and
immediately redirect them to a more sane link, such as my website.

## Final thoughts

I'm really glad I got this tattoo! Kelsey also did a great job drawing it. I
feel very powerful being able to rickroll people just by rolling my sleeves up.
